# ec2 instance types
#
# This file lists all ec2 instances types that will work with one of the
# mpi-ec2 instances (see mpi-ec2-ami-IDs for a current list of images).
#
#
#
# Each line has three elements:
#    The instance type name (per aws).
#    The instance's number of cores. This number is used to disable
#          hyperthreading.  Note that except in the cases of cc1.4xlarge, cc1.8xlarge, 
#          and cg1.4xlarge, Amazon does not specify the type of processor or
#          the actual number of cores.  It does specify the number of what
#          it terms 'virtual cores' and we use that number below.
#          Based on what we've gleaned from the ec2 forum, it seems likely
#          that in most cases these numbers do correspond to actual cores
#          (t1.micro is an obvious exception).
#    The amount of memory GB.
#    Cluster support (yes or no).
#    The instances virtualization type: pv (paravirtual) or hvm (hardware
#          virtual machine).
#    Description (per Amazon's website).

cc1.4xlarge    8  23.0  yes  hvm  2 x Intel Xeon X5570, quad-core “Nehalem” architecture.
cc2.8xlarge   16  60.5  yes  hvm  Eight-core 2 x Intel Xeon.
m1.xlarge      4  15.0   no   pv  4 virtual cores with 2 EC2 Compute Units each.
